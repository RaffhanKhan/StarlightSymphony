# Event Management System

## Overview
This project is an Event Management System composed of several microservices designed to handle various aspects of event organization, user management, ticketing, notifications, payments, analytics, and system infrastructure.

## Services

### Event Service
- Manages events including creation, update, deletion, and retrieval of event details.
- Stores information such as event name, description, date, time, location, capacity, and ticket prices.
- Provides APIs for creating, updating, and querying events.

### User Service
- Manages user profiles, authentication, and authorization.
- Handles user registration, login, profile updates, and password management.
- Integrates with the Event Service to handle user-related operations like event registration and ticket purchases.

### Ticketing Service
- Manages ticket inventory, purchases, and validations.
- Generates and validates unique tickets for events.
- Provides APIs for purchasing tickets, retrieving ticket details, and validating tickets at the event entrance.

### Notification Service
- Sends notifications to users for important event-related updates.
- Supports various notification channels such as email, SMS, and push notifications.
- Integrates with other services to trigger notifications based on specific events (e.g., event registration, ticket purchase, event updates).

### Payment Service
- Manages payment processing for ticket purchases.
- Integrates with payment gateways for handling payments securely.
- Provides APIs for initiating payment transactions and handling payment callbacks.

### Analytics Service
- Collects and analyzes data related to event attendance, ticket sales, user demographics, etc.
- Generates reports and insights to help event organizers make informed decisions.
- Provides APIs for querying analytics data and generating reports.

### Gateway Service
- Acts as the entry point for clients to interact with the microservices architecture.
- Handles routing, load balancing, and security (e.g., SSL termination).
- Provides API gateway functionality for authentication, rate limiting, etc.

### Configuration Service
- Centralized configuration management for microservices.
- Manages application properties, environment-specific configurations, etc.
- Supports dynamic configuration updates without requiring service restarts.

### Discovery Service
- Implements service discovery and registration.
- Allows services to dynamically locate and communicate with each other.
- Utilizes tools like Eureka or Consul for service discovery.

### Monitoring and Logging
- Integrates with monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack for real-time monitoring of service health, performance, and logs.
- Implements centralized logging to capture and analyze logs across services.
